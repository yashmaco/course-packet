# Motivation for the Course Packet system

With most higher education moving online (with grade school to follow soon),
students are looking for a much better online learning experience, and
instructors are looking for a much better online instructional experience.
In particular, this new mode of education can potentially result in much higher
rates of student engagement and in much better learning outcomes.

Timely feedback from students to instructors and from instructors to students
will play a crucial role in improving the experience for both parties.
1. Timely feedback to the instructor on students' understanding of the material
is critical to delivering the right instruction at the right time through the
right delivery methods. As a result of feedback, the instructor may choose
to move faster or slower, include or exclude certain topics, add or remove
instructional materials, etc. Some of the feedback will be explicit, e.g.,
questions asked during the class, while some other feedback will be explicit,
e.g., students' performance on exercises and tests.
1. Timely feedback from the instructor to students will motivate them
to learn better, individually and in groups, by asking the right questions,
by seeking instructional materials at the right level of complexity, etc.
Some of the feedback will be explicit, e.g., suggestions to study specific
sections or to improve in a specific skill, while some other feedback will be explicit,
e.g., benchmarking the student's performance against those of other students.

As a result, we envision the following changes to the instructional process:
1. Much higher student engagement, due to the amount of feedback sent by students
and addressed by instructors.
1. Much better learning outcomes, due to the amount of feedback received and
addressed by students.

We also strongly believe that leaving instructors in control of the educational
process will be critical to the success of the online education systems. Therefore,
we consider instructors to be the primary users of our system, and we will give the
priority to their needs, including maintaining instructional materials and ensuring
seamless instructional delivery experience. In particular, we don't necessarily envision
this system to be real-time (synchronous), unless students' feedback tells us and
the instructor otherwise.
