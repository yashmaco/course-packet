# Motivation for the Course Packet system

With most higher education moving online (with grade school to follow soon),
students are looking for a much better online learning experience, and
instructors are looking for a much better online instructional experience.
Timely feedback from students to instructors and from instructors to students
will play a crucial role in improving the experience for both parties.

Timely feedback to the instructor on students' understanding of the material
is critical to delivering the right instruction at the right time through the
right delivery methods. As a result of feedback, the instructor may choose
to move faster or slower, include or exclude certain topics, add or remove
instructional materials, including exercises and tests, etc. Some of the feedback
will be explicit, e.g., questions asked during the class, while some other
will be explicit, e.g., students' performance on exercises and tests.

Timely feedback from the instructor to each student will motivate students
to learn better, individually and in groups, by asking the right questions,
by seeking instructional materials at the right level of complexity, etc.
Some of the feedback will be explicit, e.g., suggestions to study specific
sections or to improve in a specific skill, while some other will be explicit,
e.g., benchmarking the student's performance against those of other students.

As a result, we envision the following changes to the instructional process:
1. Much higher student engagement, due to the amount of feedback sent by students
and addressed by instructors.
1. Much better learning outcomes, due to the amount of feedback received and
addressed by students.

We believe that instructors would strongly prefer an online educational system that:
1. Provides students with additional instructional materials, depending on their needs.
1. Gives the instructors full control over the content and the delivery methods.
1. Is not necessarily real-time (synchronous).
