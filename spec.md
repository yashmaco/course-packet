# Spec of the Course Packet System

The purpose of the Course Packet (CoPa) system is to provide a collaborative
environment for instructors and students where both parties can send and
receive a variety of helpful feedback and can take appropriate actions to
address it. Most features are instructor-configurable (IC).

videos, tests, links to web pages, etc.
